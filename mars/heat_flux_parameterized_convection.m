function heat_flux_parameterized_convection(p)
% compute the heat flux into the base of the lithosphere given a history of
% mantle temperature.
% p is a data structure representing the state of the planet.
% relationship between Nu-Ra




% Qbl = k*(deltaTconv/Dconv) * abl * Rabl^beta % heat flux into the base of the lid
